:wave: **You've been invited to join Megabox!** OwO :smile:

Before I give you full access to the server, I'll need you to do a few things.

**First thing's first, please read through the server rules:**
- No posting NSFW media
- Be respectful to others
- No illegal activities
- DO NOT DISRESPECT ME (∩^ ͟ل͜^)⊃━☆ﾟ.*
We reserve the right to remove anyone who breaks these rules or any other Discord ToS.

**Next, you're gonna have to change your nickname.**
Usernames can be confusing, so we use our real-life names/nicknames in our server. Don't worry, changing your nickname is a piece of cake! :cake: To do this, respond in this direct message with `!name` followed by your real-life name or nickname. 
Here's an example: `!name {random name}`

After setting your nickname, you should be given full access to the server! I recommend visiting the #welcome page for more information on our server. ^-^

If you have any issues at all, feel free to message me here.
